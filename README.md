# Image-Authentication-System

## Overview

This project implements an image authentication system for user sign-up and sign-in. Instead of traditional passwords, users select a sequence of images during the sign-up process and authenticate by clicking on the correct images during sign-in. The system includes features for email notifications, user details display, and a custom hashing mechanism.

## Features

- User sign-up and sign-in with graphical authentication.
- Email notifications using EmailJS.
- User details are displayed in a new tab after successful sign-in.
- Custom hashing function for password security.
